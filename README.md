# Python_School-Register-System
A school register system to track grades and attendance of students. Written in Python using Tkinter.

To make it work it needs a few empty folders (Github doesn't allow for empty folders to be upoaded and I cba to create all the fake data)
The folders are as follows:

"grades" which contain 4 folders "English" "Geography" "History" "Math" which each contain 4 folders "A" "B" "C" "D"

"attendance" which contains 4 folders "A" "B" "C" "D" which each contain 4 folders "English" "Geography" "History" "Math"

Definitely not a great way to do it but this was my first year at uni.
